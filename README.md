# python_for_minecraft
some python scripts for some minecraft pixelart activities

For all the script you will need to drag and drop the image on it or use the command prompt as "python script.py file"

FunctionGen.py is a script to create a list of minecraft command to help with creating pixel art. Drag and drop the image you want to "pixel-arting" and it will create a fun.mcfunction (that is basically a txt) with all the commands to copy paste in mc command prompt.
Image2PixelArt.py create a file (with the same extension as the source) that will represent the pixel-art.
PixelArtGen.py will create a txt file with the start position from where to start placing the numbered blocks of a certain type. Each line is for a single type of block. When there is a blank line it means you move the row above.
PixelArtReader.py is a script to read the previusly generated txt and iterate line by line on the press of a key (I set "K", change it at your will).
